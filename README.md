# Javascript Leaflet Earthquake Visualization
Module 15 Challenge

An interactive map was created using Leaflet to display the earthquakes that occured within the past seven days. <br> 

The magnitude of the earthquake is represented by the size of the marker (the larger the marker, the larger the magnitude). The depth of the earthquake is represented by the marker color and shown in the legend. A popup was created to display the place, magnitude, and depth of the earthquake and can be shown by clicking on the marker.
